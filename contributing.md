# How to Contribute

Just edit the README and create a pull request! We may restructure how the ideas are organized if the list grows too long.

All types of project ideas are welcome. Here are a few guidelines:

1. Please follow this format:

```markdown
### Project Name

Project summary/description.
```

2. Try to avoid requesting specific programming languages or frameworks in the project summary. That is a detail that is up to the person doing it to decide.

### What to include in the description?

Try to explain the project idea as clearly as possible. For example, _How should users interact with the application?_ _What are the inputs and outputs to the program?_
